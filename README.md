SNAPNAO
=======



_We photograph the special moments of our lives but it is not necessarily those moments that make life special. In not preserving the seemingly 
mundane, not noticing the details of routine, that so easily are overlooked and forgotten, we rob ourselves of some of the best memories. 
Prompting people to randomly  take a snapshot of their life’s, preserving it regardless of context, gives us a way to recall the normal in 
years to come. SNAPNAO does exactly that. At random times your phone will prompt you to take a quick picture. You can just store them on your 
phone or share them via email or with your followers on twitter and tumblr._

### Privacy

Privacy if naturally an important issue when taking pictures of ones life. SNAPNAO does not take a picture without user interaction so you are 
always aware of when a photo as taken and can point the camera at what you chooses to. It is, as with every photo-app, up to you not to 
violate other peoples privacy with the photos you take. All Data is only stored locally or shared with the services you select. You can stop 
sharing with those services whenever you wish.

### Basic Principles

The Basic App contains one Activity to explain the concept of the app and a background service that at random times, creates a notification for 
the user to make a snapshot. Pictures are stored on the phones memory and added to a SNAPNAO Gallery on the phone. They can also be shared on 
social networking sites.
